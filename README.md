# Car-pooling-project
A final project of Cloud Computing course CS5226 at National University of Singapore.

Implemented a new Car pooling algorithm, that matches riders to drivers if the riders destination route is within 5 km of drivers route, so that the driver doesnt have to take a long detour.

Used google maps route's api to calculate the distance and route and the solution was implemented on AWS using AWS lambda. Unfortunatey since hosting the app on AWS required credit, there's no working demo of the same, but I have provided the codes used and the project report and flow to help understand the project better.
